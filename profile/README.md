# 🧠 Nugget Tech

Welcome to **Nugget Tech**, a home for tools and systems designed to make AI more adaptable, understandable, and user-controlled.

We're building a flexible, **multimodal** AI chatbot system that runs across multiple platforms—with a focus on customization, clarity, and control.

---

## 🔧 What We're Building

Nugget is a modular chatbot framework built with:

* **Multibot Containerization**
  Each bot runs in its own Docker container, making deployment cleaner and more organized.

* **Real-Time Config Management**
  Bots can receive config and prompt updates on the fly—no restarts needed.

* **Context Awareness**
  Bots track per-channel context to maintain natural, flowing conversations.

* **Web Panel**
  A control center for creating, updating, and managing your bots in real time.
